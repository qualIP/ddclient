Template: ddclient/newconfigfmt
Type: note
_Description: More powerful configuration
 The new ddclient version allows you to store all options in the
 configuration file instead of passing them in your scripts. Apart from
 that ddclient now supports different protocols and services, different
 ways to figure out your internet address including gathering it from a
 firewall status page.
 .
 In any case the configuration file /etc/ddclient.conf will be updated to
 be a bit more readable and the protocol will be updated to dyndns2. This
 is neccessary as dyndns.org switched off support for the dyndns1 protocol
 on January 1st 2002.
 .
 If you want to make use of the new options through this frontend please
 run "dpkg-reconfigure ddclient".

Template: ddclient/modifiedconfig
Type: note
_Description: Modified configuration file
 The config file /etc/ddclient.conf on your system does not consist of
 three entries. The automatic configuration utility (debconf) cannot handle
 this. Maybe you modified the configuration file manually, thus it won't
 be modified. If you want a new config file to be created, please run 
 "dpkg-reconfigure ddclient".
