Template: ddclient/newconfigfmt
Type: note
Description: More powerful configuration
 The new ddclient version allows you to store all options in the configuration
 file instead of passing them in your scripts. Apart from that ddclient now
 supports different protocols and services, different ways to figure out 
 your internet address including gathering it from a firewall status page.
 .
 In any case the configuration file /etc/ddclient.conf will be updated 
 to be a bit more readable and the protocol will be updated to dyndns2. 
 This is neccessary as dyndns.org switched off support for the dyndns1
 protocol on January 1st 2002. 
 .
 If you want to make use of the new options through this frontend please
 run dpkg-reconfigure ddclient.

Template: ddclient/modifiedconfig
Type: note
Description: Modified configuration file
 The config file /etc/ddclient.conf on your system does not consist of three
 entries. The automatic configuration utility debconf cannot handle this.
 Maybe you modified the configuration file manually, so I won't touch it. If
 you want me to create a new config, please run dpkg-reconfigure ddclient.
