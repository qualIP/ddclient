Once again it has been to before releasing a new version of ddclient.  This
version has some minor changes which are all logged in the ChangeLog file.

	* Fixing #28: FreeDNS.afraid.org changed api slightly
	* Added dtdns-support
	* Added support for longer password
	* Added cisco-asa patch
	* Added support for LoopiaDNS

Hopefully we will be able to release the next version of ddclient much sooner.
